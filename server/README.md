In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

The npm run dev command runs the index.js file using the nodemon utility.

Nodemon is a tool that helps you develop Node.js-based applications by automatically restarting your Node.js application when changes to files in the directory1 are detected. It doesn't require any additional changes to your code or development method. Nodemon is a wrapper replacement for node.
